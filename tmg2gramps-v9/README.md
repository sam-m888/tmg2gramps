Modified version to handle TMG version 9.05 files by Ian Strang.

The official version of tmg2gramps and the modified tmg2gramps-v8 files does not work with well with TMG v9 databases.

This can be corrected with a modified tmg2gramps-v8_altered_by_ian.pl file, which can be downloaded here.

To apply this upgrade, you must first unpack the official download, and then overwrite the tmg2gramps.pl file with the version above.
