The official version of tmg2gramps does not work with well with TMG v8 databases, because of changed relation types. This can be corrected with a modified tmg2gramps.pl file, which can be downloaded [[Media:Tmg2gramps-v8.gz|here]]. To apply this upgrade, you must first unpack the official download, and then overwrite the tmg2gramps.pl file with the version above.
