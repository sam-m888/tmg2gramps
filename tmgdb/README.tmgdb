The files tmgdb.* and tmgfstr.rtf attempt to partially document the database
format of The Master Genealogist. It is hoped the availability of this
information will permit greater interoperability between TMG and other
genealogical programs.

tmgfstr.rtf is a file I found on the web, and appears to have been authored
by Wholly Genes, the owners of TMG. It documents version 3.x of the database
format. I make it available here as an aid to understanding tmgdb.*.

At the time of writing this, TMG is at version 6, and its database format is
significantly different to that of version 3.x.

tmgdb.* is based on tmgfstr.rtf, plus some reverse engineering of the
version 6 format. As such, it partially documents the TMG database format
for Version 6.x. It is a simple summary of the parts of the database in
which I was interested. The diagram does not use any particular standards,
but is based on what tools were easily available to me. Therefore it
requires some explanation.

Each box represents a database table. The non-db-specific part of the name
of the table is between << and >>. So if the TMG database (project) name is
'fred', and a box in this diagram has 'NPV' between << and >>, then the
table will be fred_npv.

Next in each box is a short text hint as to what type of data this table
holds.

Below the line in each box is a list of fields, named as they are in the
table, followed by a colon and a code representing the type of that field.
The types used match those used by other DBF (or xBase) documentation, and
hence should be easy to interpret.

Links (foreign keys and the like) between tables are represented by arrows.
The arrow head is on the end of the foreign key. The field names at each end
of the arrow are the names of the fields which form the links between the
tables.

The '+' everywhere are not significant.

The tables on the diagram that do not have any fields are ones I had no
interest in, and hence did not attempt to document.

I am making the tmgdb diagram available in several formats, but the original
one is the DIA format created by the DIA diagram editor.

I relinquish any claim to copyright over this diagram. I also make no
guarantee over its accuracy. It was accurate enough for me to be able to use
it to manipulate the information I wanted in my TMG database, but it may or
may not be helpful to you.

I do not intend to maintain or update this diagram in any way, so don't
bother sending me patches or pointing out changes I should make. However if
you create a similar diagram of your own with more detail, or for a
different version of TMG, I am willing to make it available for download by
others from the same location as this diagram.
